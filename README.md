## Your 1v1 NBA Player Predictor

There are a lot of players in the NBA who have always played in 5 on 5 scenarios, but very few have ever played against another player in a 1v1 matchup. This obviously begs the question, based on what we know about players and their 5 on 5 stats, can we predict who would win in a 1 on 1 scenario? This is the question we aim to answer using our machine learning model. Given that direct 1v1 data is nearly nonexistent, our project aims to build a machine learning model that can predict the outcome of a hypothetical 1-on-1 matchup between any two players based solely on available 5-on-5 statistics and player attributes.
